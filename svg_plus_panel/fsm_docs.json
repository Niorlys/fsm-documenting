  "states": {
    "solid": "In the solid state, matter has a fixed shape and volume. Particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place.",
    "liquid": "In the liquid state, matter has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container.",

  "transitions": {
    "melt": "Transition from solid to liquid.\n        \n        This simulates melting, where a solid absorbs heat and becomes a liquid.",
    "freeze": "Transition from liquid to solid.\n        \n        This simulates freezing, where a liquid loses heat and solidifies.",
